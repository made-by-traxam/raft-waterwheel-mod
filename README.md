**Official Raft-Mods page of this project:** https://raft-mods.trax.am/mods/waterwheel

**This is the first mod release that adds a fully-functional block to the game!**

This mods adds a Water Wheel into the game. The water wheel (or water mill) works like a pump and automatically transports water from the ocean right into your purifier so you don't have to do that! This mod is still in development, so please **make a backup of your world** and feel free to [contribute](https://gitlab.com/traxam/raft-waterwheels-mod).

## Crafting
This item can be crafted in the normal crafting menu. The water wheel is available in the *Food and Water* section. The water wheel is relatively expensive because it is intended as a late-game item that is only used to save you some work. The recipe might be changed in the future.

## Usage
The water wheel is a foundation block and can as such only be placed directly above the water. Note that the wheel has a spigot attached. Place a purifier (both the basic and the advanced purifiers work) beneath the spigot to direct the water to it as shown below. The water wheel will automatically add one unit of water to the purifier every 20 seconds.

## Compatibility
- For Raft and Raft-Mod-Loader compatibility, please visit the [versions page](/mods/waterwheel/versions).
- There are currently no known incompatibilities to other mods.
- Please make sure to **never load a world that once had waterwheel items and blocks in it without the mod**. This will break the save file and it will be lost forever, so please make a backup before using this mod.
- This mod should be multiplayer-compatible, but is currently untested. Every player needs to have the mod or it won't work.
